# Case description
Project Objective – Plato’s Pizza BI Challenge

In this project, I took on the role of a Business Intelligence Consultant for Plato’s Pizza, a Greek-inspired restaurant in New Jersey. The goal was to help the business become more data-driven by analyzing customer transactions and uncovering opportunities to increase sales and improve operational efficiency.
The analysis was designed to answer key business questions, including:
- Restaurant traffic patterns – What days and times are the busiest?
- Operational load – How many pizzas are prepared during peak periods?
- Menu performance – Which pizzas are the best and worst sellers?
- Financial insights – What is the average order value?
- Capacity utilization – How effectively is the restaurant using its seating capacity (15 tables, 60 seats total)?
